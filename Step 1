Step 1 

run => npm run node_1 to start the node for four node

http://localhost:4001/blockchain

create a trensaction in one node
http://localhost:4001/transaction


that is not reflection to other nodes

for that we have to make network broadcast

http://localhost:4001/register-and-broadcast-node

Now create a transaction brodcast to any node

http://localhost:4001/transaction/broadcast


Consensus for node 5

http://localhost:4005/consensus




http://localhost:4005/transaction/:transactionId
http://localhost:4005/address/:address
http://localhost:4005/block/:blockHash
http://localhost:4001/block-explorer





mine http://localhost:4001/mine
